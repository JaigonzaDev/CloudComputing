# **Description**

In this lab, you will migrate your webserver using the re-platform migration strategy and migrate your application to the cloud with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. In this lab, you use public and private subnets, security groups, and ACLs to create a three-security zone network infrastructure. You then use VPC flow logs to monitor the traffic that reaches the resources in each zone to verify only the required traffic is allowed.

# **Objectives**

- Prepare your application source code for migration to AWS.
- Upload your application source code version to an S3 Bucket.
- Create an Elastic Beanstalk application and launch an environment.
- Review and manage the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

# **AWS Services**

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
