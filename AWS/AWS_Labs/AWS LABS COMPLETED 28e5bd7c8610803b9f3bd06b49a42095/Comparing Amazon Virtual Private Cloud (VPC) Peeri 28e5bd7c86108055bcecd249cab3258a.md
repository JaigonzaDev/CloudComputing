# **Description**

This lab introduces you to Amazon VPC peering and AWS Transit Gateway usage. In this lab you will configure network routing between 3 Amazon VPC's located in the 2 AWS regions. Each Amazon VPC contains a two EC2 instances. Initially, you will use Amazon VPC peering to configure network connectivity. Afterwards, you will replace the Amazon VPC peering with AWS Transit Gateway, and compare the two features.

# **Objectives**

- Create highly available and resilient network connections through VPC peering
- Configure VPC peering routing control
- Create highly available and resilient network connections through AWS Transit Gateway
- Configure AWS Transit Gateway routing control

# **AWS Services**

- AWS Transit Gateway
- Amazon VPC
