# **Description**

This lab takes you through the process of updating AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) trust policies and assuming roles. You will practice building policies that users can assume to obtain elevated permissions on an as-needed basis. You will also learn how to revoke sessions using conditional statements. Completing this lab will allow you to see how role assumption helps lock down access to your AWS accounts. This lab will also challenge you to programmatically assume a role for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.
