# **Description**

When considering Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), you should understand the performance characteristics of the file system and how Amazon EC2 instance types, I/O size, and parallelism can affect the performance. In this lab, you review scenarios that use various file creation and copy tools to showcase the way that different Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instance types, I/O, and numbers of threads accessing Amazon EFS can have an impact on performance. You also use an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard with custom metrics created using metric math to monitor the activities with common storage metrics.

# **Objectives**

- EC2 instance types affect EFS performance.
- I/O size (block size) and sync frequency affect EFS performance.
- Increasing the number of threads accessing EFS can improve performance.
- Different file transfer tools affect performance when accessing an EFS file system.
- Scale-out data transfer using multiple EC2 instances can improve EFS performance.
