# **Description**

Compute services are the backbone that power most web-based applications. They are the foundation on which many Amazon Web Services (AWS) offerings are built. This course provides a high-level overview of the three main categories of compute services on AWS: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Containers (Amazon Elastic Container Service and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service), and Serverless (AWS Lambda). This course includes a use case scenario to help you learn how to differentiate between the different compute options and how to select the best compute option for a given workload. Take the next step and apply your learning hands-on, by unlocking access to 1,000 lab experiences with a Skill Builder subscription. We recommend trying this guided AWS Builder Lab: Introduction to Amazon EC2.
