# AWS Federated Authentication with AD FS

[LINK](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/AD7NYNYQTD/aws-federated-authentication-with-ad-fs/FEC6UXBRP1)

# **Description**

This lab will take you through the process of configuring Windows AD FS with AWS IAM, which enables you to access your AWS Management Console with the desired Active Directory users and groups. You will leverage the AWS support for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an open standard used by many identity providers. This feature enables federated single sign-on (SSO), which lets users sign in to the AWS Management Console or make programmatic calls to AWS APIs by using assertions from a SAML-compliant identity provider (IdP) like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

# **Objectives**

- Install and set up AD FS on a Windows server
- Enable federated access to the AWS Management Console using an existing Active Directory server
- Create new roles in IAM and map those to your federated users
- Allow federated users to have access to the AWS Management Console

# **AWS Services**

- AWS Identity and Access Management
