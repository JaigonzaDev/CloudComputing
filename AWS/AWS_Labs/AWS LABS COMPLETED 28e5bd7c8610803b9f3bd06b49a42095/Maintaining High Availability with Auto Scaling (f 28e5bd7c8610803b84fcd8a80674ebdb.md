# Maintaining High Availability with Auto Scaling (for Linux)

# **Description**

This lab introduces the basics of Auto Scaling, highlighting multiple Auto Scaling use cases and the command-line tools used for Auto Scaling configuration. After completing this lab you will have configured and tested an elastic web farm which automatically scales capacity to accommodate load. In addition you will have explored a steady state use case in which Auto Scaling is used to maintain high availability of critical resources.

# **Objectives**

- Create a new launch configuration using command-line tools
- Create a new Auto Scaling group using command line tools
- Configure Auto Scaling notifications that are triggered when instance resources become too high or too low
- Create policies to scale up or scale down the number of currently running instances in response to changes in resource utilization
