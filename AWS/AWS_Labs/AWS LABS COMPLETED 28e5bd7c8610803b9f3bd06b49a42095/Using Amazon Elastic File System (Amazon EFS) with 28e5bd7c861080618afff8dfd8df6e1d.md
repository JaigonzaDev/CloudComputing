# **Description**

In this lab, you learn how to quickly create and configure an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. As part of this process, you mount your file system in an AWS Cloud9 instance. Also, you will setup EFS as a shared application package repository and test a serverless video processing workflow with AWS Lambda.

# **Objectives**

- Create and configure an Amazon EFS file system
- Add file system access point, and configure client permissions
- Configure an AWS Lambda function to use an EFS file system for persistent storage
- Install EFS utils client for NFS file access, and mount the file system to an AWS Cloud9 instance
- Test a serverless video processing workflow with AWS Lambda and Amazon EFS

# **AWS Services**

- Amazon Elastic File System
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Cloud9
