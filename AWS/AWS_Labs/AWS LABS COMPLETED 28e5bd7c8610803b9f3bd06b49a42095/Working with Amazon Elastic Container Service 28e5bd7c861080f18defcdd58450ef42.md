# **Description**

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. This lab leads you through the steps to create Task Definitions from Docker containers, populate an ECS Cluster with Load Balanced EC2 Instances, deploy Tasks to the Cluster, make revisions, and scale up the Cluster.

# **Objectives**

- Create an ECS Task Definition
- Populate an ECS Cluster
- Deploy an application to an ECS Service
- Deploy an application update by changing the Task Definition
- Scale up the application
