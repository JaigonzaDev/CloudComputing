# **Description**

This lab provides you with an introduction to Elastic Load Balancer. It covers creating and testing a Network Elastic Load Balancer. When the lab is launched you are provided with two web servers in two different Availability Zones. In the lab you will create a Network Elastic Load Balancer and use the two Web Servers as targets. You will then test the functionality of the load balancer in different scenarios.

# **Objectives**

- Test connectivity to two web servers that reside in two different Availability Zones
- Create a Network Load Balancer and use the two web servers as Elastic Load Balancer targets
- Test the default functionality of your load balancer
- Enabled Cross-Zone load balancing and test how your load balancer behaves
- Test the behavior of your load balancer during a failure of one of your web servers
- Test the behavior of your load balancer after your web server has recovered from the failure
