# Exam 1

A video analytics organization has been acquired by a leading media company. The analytics organization has 10 independent applications with an on-premises data footprint of about 70 Terabytes for each application. The CTO of the media company has set a timeline of two weeks to carry out the data migration from on-premises data center to AWS Cloud and establish connectivity.

Which of the following are the MOST cost-effective options for completing the data transfer and establishing connectivity? (Select two)

Setup AWS Site-to-Site VPN to establish on-going connectivity between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud

Order 70 AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices to complete the one-time data transfer

Order 10 AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices to complete the one-time data transfer

Setup AWS Direct Connect to establish connectivity between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud

Order 1 AWS Snowmobile to complete the one-time data transfer

**Order 10 AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices to complete the one-time data transfer**

AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 Terabytes of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gigabytes network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.

As each Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device can handle 80 Terabytes of data, you can order 10 such devices to take care of the data transfer for all applications.

Exam Alert:

The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original Snowball device had 80 Terabytes of storage space.

**Setup AWS Site-to-Site VPN to establish on-going connectivity between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud**

AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity.

Therefore this option is the right fit for the given use-case as the connectivity can be easily established within the given timeframe.

Incorrect options:

**Order 1 AWS Snowmobile to complete the one-time data transfer** - Each AWS Snowmobile has a total capacity of up to 100 petabytes. To migrate large datasets of 10 petabytes or more in a single location, you should use AWS Snowmobile. For datasets less than 10 petabytes or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball. So AWS Snowmobile is not the right fit for this use-case.

**Setup AWS Direct Connect to establish connectivity between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud** - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry-standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your intranet and Amazon VPC. Direct Connect involves significant monetary investment and takes at least a month to set up, therefore it's not the correct fit for this use-case.

**Order 70 AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices to complete the one-time data transfer** - As the data-transfer can be completed with just 10 AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices, there is no need to order 70 devices.

EN TRANSFERIRSE CON SNOWBALL EDGE A AWS TARDA 80TB DE DATOS MÁS O MENOS UNA SEMANA. Direct connect tarda mas de dos semanas en implementarse ya que necesitas establecer un conexión física con el proveedor y hay velocidades como la de 1Gbps que no llegaría, 10 Gbps tampoco y 100 Gbps llegaría pero solo se encuentra en zonas específicas.

A news network uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to aggregate the raw video footage from its reporting teams across the US. The news network has recently expanded into new geographies in Europe and Asia. The technical teams at the overseas branch offices have reported huge delays in uploading large video files to the destination Amazon S3 bucket.

Which of the following are the MOST cost-effective options to improve the file upload speed into Amazon S3 (Select two)

Create multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use these VPN connections for faster file uploads into Amazon S3

Use AWS Global Accelerator for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket

Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket

Create multiple AWS Direct Connect connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use the direct connect connections for faster file uploads into Amazon S3

Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to enable faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket

**Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to enable faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket**

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Amazon S3TA takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

**Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket**

Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. Multipart upload provides improved throughput, therefore it facilitates faster file uploads.

Incorrect options:

**Create multiple AWS Direct Connect connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use the direct connect connections for faster file uploads into Amazon S3** - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Direct connect takes significant time (several months) to be provisioned and is an overkill for the given use-case.

**Create multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use these VPN connections for faster file uploads into Amazon S3** - AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections are a good solution if you have low to modest bandwidth requirements and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. Site-to-site VPN will not help in accelerating the file transfer speeds into S3 for the given use-case.

**Use AWS Global Accelerator for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket** - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. AWS Global Accelerator will not help in accelerating the file transfer speeds into S3 for the given use-case.

A retail company uses Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon RDS, Elastic Load Balancer and Amazon CloudFront services. To improve the security of these services, the Risk Advisory group has suggested a feasibility check for using the Amazon GuardDuty service.

Which of the following would you identify as data sources supported by Amazon GuardDuty?

VPC Flow Logs, Domain Name System (DNS) logs, AWS CloudTrail events

Amazon CloudFront logs, Amazon API Gateway logs, AWS CloudTrail events

VPC Flow Logs, Amazon API Gateway logs, Amazon S3 access logs

Elastic Load Balancing logs, Domain Name System (DNS) logs, AWS CloudTrail events

**VPC Flow Logs, Domain Name System (DNS) logs, AWS CloudTrail events**

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3. With the cloud, the collection and aggregation of account and network activities is simplified, but it can be time-consuming for security teams to continuously analyze event log data for potential threats. With GuardDuty, you now have an intelligent and cost-effective option for continuous threat detection in AWS. The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats.

Amazon GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.

With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, GuardDuty can be enabled with no software or hardware to deploy or maintain. By integrating with Amazon EventBridge Events, GuardDuty alerts are actionable, easy to aggregate across multiple accounts, and straightforward to push into existing event management and workflow systems.

Ahí se menciona que **las fuentes de datos soportadas son**:

✅ **VPC Flow Logs**

✅ **AWS CloudTrail events**

✅ **DNS logs**

✅ **Amazon S3 logs** (solo para protección de buckets, no acceso general)

✅ **Kubernetes audit logs** (si usas Amazon EKS)

❌ **Fuentes NO soportadas directamente:**

- **Elastic Load Balancing logs**
- **Amazon CloudFront logs**
- **Amazon API Gateway logs**
- **AWS WAF logs**
- **AWS Shield logs**

The solo founder at a tech startup has just created a brand new AWS account. The founder has provisioned an Amazon EC2 instance 1A which is running in AWS Region A. Later, he takes a snapshot of the instance 1A and then creates a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in Region A from this snapshot. This AMI is then copied into another Region B. The founder provisions an instance 1B in Region B using this new AMI in Region B.

At this point in time, what entities exist in Region B?

1 Amazon EC2 instance and 1 snapshot exist in Region B

1 Amazon EC2 instance and 2 AMIs exist in Region B

1 Amazon EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot exist in Region B

1 Amazon EC2 instance and 1 AMI exist in Region B

**1 Amazon EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot exist in Region B**

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. When the new AMI is copied from Region A into Region B, it automatically creates a snapshot in Region B because AMIs are based on the underlying snapshots. Further, an instance is created from this AMI in Region B. Hence, we have 1 Amazon EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot in Region B.

A Big Data analytics company wants to set up an AWS cloud architecture that throttles requests in case of sudden traffic spikes. The company is looking for AWS services that can be used for buffering or throttling to handle such traffic variations.

Which of the following services can be used to support this requirement?

Elastic Load Balancer, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Lambda

Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Kinesis

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and AWS Lambda

Amazon Gateway Endpoints, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Kinesis

Throttling (control de tráfico) is the process of limiting the number of requests an authorized program can submit to a given operation in a given amount of time.

**Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Kinesis**

To prevent your API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, Amazon API Gateway throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token counts for a request. Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request submissions against all APIs in your account. In the token bucket algorithm, the burst is the maximum bucket size.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SQS offers buffer capabilities to smooth out temporary volume spikes without losing messages or increasing latency.

Amazon Kinesis - Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed, scalable service that can ingest, buffer, and process streaming data in real-time.

Incorrect options:

**Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and AWS Lambda** - Amazon SQS has the ability to buffer its messages. Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) cannot buffer messages and is generally used with SQS to provide the buffering facility. When requests come in faster than your Lambda function can scale, or when your function is at maximum concurrency, additional requests fail as the Lambda throttles those requests with error code 429 status code. So, this combination of services is incorrect.

**Amazon Gateway Endpoints, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Kinesis** - A Gateway Endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. This cannot help in throttling or buffering of requests. Amazon SQS and Kinesis can buffer incoming data. Since Gateway Endpoint is an incorrect service for throttling or buffering, this option is incorrect.

**Elastic Load Balancer, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Lambda** - Elastic Load Balancer cannot throttle requests. Amazon SQS can be used to buffer messages. When requests come in faster than your Lambda function can scale, or when your function is at maximum concurrency, additional requests fail as the Lambda throttles those requests with error code 429 status code. So, this combination of services is incorrect.

A major bank is using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to migrate several core banking applications to the cloud to ensure high availability and cost efficiency while simplifying administrative complexity and overhead. The development team at the bank expects a peak rate of about 1000 messages per second to be processed via SQS. It is important that the messages are processed in order.

Which of the following options can be used to implement this system?

Use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue in batch mode of 2 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate

Use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue to process the messages

Use Amazon SQS standard queue to process the messages

Use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate

**Use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate**

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues - Standard queues vs FIFO queues.

For FIFO queues, the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved (i.e. First-In-First-Out). On the other hand, the standard SQS queues offer best-effort ordering. This means that occasionally, messages might be delivered in an order different from which they were sent.

By default, FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second). When you batch 10 messages per operation (maximum), FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 messages per second. Therefore you need to process 4 messages per operation so that the FIFO queue can support up to 1200 messages per second, which is well within the peak rate.

A leading social media analytics company is contemplating moving its dockerized application stack into AWS Cloud. The company is not sure about the pricing for using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with the EC2 launch type compared to the Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with the Fargate launch type.

Which of the following is correct regarding the pricing for these two services?

Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type is charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used. Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type is charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests

Both Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type and Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type are charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests

Both Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type and Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type are charged based on Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes used

Both Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type and Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type are just charged based on Elastic Container Service used per hour

The engineering team at an e-commerce company wants to establish a dedicated, encrypted, low latency, and high throughput connection between its data center and AWS Cloud. The engineering team has set aside sufficient time to account for the operational overhead of establishing this connection.

As a solutions architect, which of the following solutions would you recommend to the company?

Use AWS Transit Gateway to establish a connection between the data center and AWS Cloud

Use AWS site-to-site VPN to establish a connection between the data center and AWS Cloud

Use AWS Direct Connect to establish a connection between the data center and AWS Cloud

Use AWS Direct Connect plus virtual private network (VPN) to establish a connection between the data center and AWS Cloud

**Use AWS Direct Connect plus virtual private network (VPN) to establish a connection between the data center and AWS Cloud**

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.

With AWS Direct Connect plus VPN, you can combine one or more AWS Direct Connect dedicated network connections with the Amazon VPC VPN. This combination provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection that also reduces network costs, increases bandwidth throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than internet-based VPN connections.

This solution combines the AWS managed benefits of the VPN solution with low latency, increased bandwidth, more consistent benefits of the AWS Direct Connect solution, and an end-to-end, secure IPsec connection. Therefore, AWS Direct Connect plus VPN is the correct solution for this use-case.

A software engineering intern at an e-commerce company is documenting the process flow to provision Amazon EC2 instances via the Amazon EC2 API. These instances are to be used for an internal application that processes Human Resources payroll data. He wants to highlight those volume types that cannot be used as a boot volume.

Can you help the intern by identifying those storage volume types that CANNOT be used as boot volumes while creating the instances? (Select two)

Provisioned IOPS Solid state drive (io1)

Throughput Optimized Hard disk drive (st1)

Cold Hard disk drive (sc1)

Instance Store

General Purpose Solid State Drive (gp2)

## **Amazon EBS-backed instances**

Instances that use Amazon EBS for the root volume automatically have an Amazon EBS volume attached. When you launch an Amazon EBS-backed instance, we create an Amazon EBS volume for each Amazon EBS snapshot referenced by the AMI you use. You can optionally use other Amazon EBS volumes or instance store volumes, depending on the instance type.

### Limitation

You can't use `st1` or `sc1` EBS volumes as root volumes.

A company has a web application that runs 24*7 in the production environment. The development team at the company runs a clone of the same application in the dev environment for up to 8 hours every day. The company wants to build the MOST cost-optimal solution by deploying these applications using the best-fit pricing options for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

What would you recommend?

Use Amazon EC2 reserved instance (RI) for the production application and spot instances for the dev application

Use Amazon EC2 reserved instance (RI) for the production application and spot block instances for the dev application

Use Amazon EC2 reserved instance (RI) for the production application and on-demand instances for the dev application

Use on-demand Amazon EC2 instances for the production application and spot instances for the dev application

**Use Amazon EC2 reserved instance (RI) for the production application and spot block instances for the dev application** - Spot blocks can only be used for a span of up to 6 hours, so this option does not meet the requirements of the given use case where the dev application can be up and running up to 8 hours. You should also note that AWS has stopped offering Spot blocks to new customers.

The engineering team at a Spanish professional football club has built a notification system for its website using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications which are then handled by an AWS Lambda function for end-user delivery. During the off-season, the notification systems need to handle about 100 requests per second. During the peak football season, the rate touches about 5000 requests per second and it is noticed that a significant number of the notifications are not being delivered to the end-users on the website.

As a solutions architect, which of the following would you suggest as the BEST possible solution to this issue?

The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the Amazon SNS service

Amazon SNS message deliveries to AWS Lambda have crossed the account concurrency quota for AWS Lambda, so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit

Amazon SNS has hit a scalability limit, so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit

The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the AWS Lambda service

WS Lambda currently supports 1000 concurrent executions per AWS account per region. If your Amazon SNS message deliveries to AWS Lambda contribute to crossing these concurrency quotas, your Amazon SNS message deliveries will be throttled. You need to contact AWS support to raise the account limit. Therefore this option is correct.

Incorrect options:

**Amazon SNS has hit a scalability limit, so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit** - Amazon SNS leverages the proven AWS cloud to dynamically scale with your application. You don't need to contact AWS support, as SNS is a fully managed service, taking care of the heavy lifting related to capacity planning, provisioning, monitoring, and patching. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

**The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the Amazon SNS service**

**The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the AWS Lambda service**

As both AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS are serverless and fully managed services, the engineering team cannot provision more servers. Both of these options are incorrect.

A file-hosting service uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) under the hood to power its storage offerings. Currently all the customer files are uploaded directly under a single Amazon S3 bucket. The engineering team has started seeing scalability issues where customer file uploads have started failing during the peak access hours with more than 5000 requests per second.

Which of the following is the MOST resource efficient and cost-optimal way of addressing this issue?

Change the application architecture to create a new Amazon S3 bucket for each customer and then upload each customer's files directly under the respective buckets

Change the application architecture to create customer-specific custom prefixes within the single Amazon S3 bucket and then upload the daily files into those prefixed locations

Change the application architecture to create a new Amazon S3 bucket for each day's data and then upload the daily files directly under that day's bucket

Change the application architecture to use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) instead of Amazon S3 for storing the customers' uploaded files

No tiene sentido mi opción porque crear un bucket por cada cliente es ineficiente ademçás de que tienen que ser globalmente únicos.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html

Your applications can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request performance when uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3. Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates. For example, your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per partitioned Amazon S3 prefix. There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by using parallelization. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second. Similarly, you can scale write operations by writing to multiple prefixes. The scaling, in the case of both read and write operations, happens gradually and is not instantaneous. While Amazon S3 is scaling to your new higher request rate, you may see some 503 (Slow Down) errors. These errors will dissipate when the scaling is complete. For more information about creating and using prefixes, see [Organizing objects using prefixes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-prefixes.html).

A new DevOps engineer has just joined a development team and wants to understand the replication capabilities for Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment as well as Amazon RDS Read-replicas.

Which of the following correctly summarizes these capabilities for the given database?

Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans one Availability Zone (AZ) within a single region. Read replicas follow synchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a single region. Read replicas follow synchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

**Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region**

Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for RDS database (DB) instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Multi-AZ spans at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a single region.

Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB) instances. They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance.

Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance. Read replicas can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region.

healthcare startup needs to enforce compliance and regulatory guidelines for objects stored in Amazon S3. One of the key requirements is to provide adequate protection against accidental deletion of objects.

As a solutions architect, what are your recommendations to address these guidelines? (Select two) ?

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete on the Amazon S3 bucket

Establish a process to get managerial approval for deleting Amazon S3 objects

Enable versioning on the Amazon S3 bucket

Change the configuration on Amazon S3 console so that the user needs to provide additional confirmation while deleting any Amazon S3 object

Create an event trigger on deleting any Amazon S3 object. The event invokes an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification via email to the IT manager

A research group runs its flagship application on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances for a specialized task that must deliver high random I/O performance. Each instance in the fleet would have access to a dataset that is replicated across the instances by the application itself. Because of the resilient application architecture, the specialized task would continue to be processed even if any instance goes down, as the underlying application would ensure the replacement instance has access to the required dataset.

Which of the following options is the MOST cost-optimal and resource-efficient solution to build this fleet of Amazon EC2 instances?

Use Instance Store based Amazon EC2 instances

Use Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EFS mount points

Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) based EC2 instances

Use Amazon EC2 instances with access to Amazon S3 based storage

**Use Instance Store based Amazon EC2 instances**

An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host instance. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost.

As Instance Store based volumes provide high random I/O performance at low cost (as the storage is part of the instance's usage cost) and the resilient architecture can adjust for the loss of any instance, therefore you should use Instance Store based Amazon EC2 instances for this use-case.

A company manages a multi-tier social media application that runs on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and use an Amazon Aurora database. As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, you have been tasked to make the application more resilient to periodic spikes in request rates.

Which of the following solutions would you recommend for the given use-case? (Select two)

Use AWS Global Accelerator

Use AWS Shield

Use AWS Direct Connect

Use Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the Application Load Balancer

Use Amazon Aurora Replica

---

A media company runs a photo-sharing web application that is accessed across three different countries. The application is deployed on several Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances running behind an Application Load Balancer. With new government regulations, the company has been asked to block access from two countries and allow access only from the home country of the company.

Which configuration should be used to meet this changed requirement?

Configure the security group for the Amazon EC2 instances

Configure the security group on the Application Load Balancer

Configure AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) on the Application Load Balancer in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

Use Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) is a web application firewall service that lets you monitor web requests and protect your web applications from malicious requests. Use AWS WAF to block or allow requests based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses. You can also use AWS WAF preconfigured protections to block common attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

**Configure AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) on the Application Load Balancer in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)**

You can use AWS WAF with your Application Load Balancer to allow or block requests based on the rules in a web access control list (web ACL). Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF allows you to use AWS WAF to restrict application access based on the geographic location of your viewers. With geo match conditions you can choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access.

Geo match conditions are important for many customers. For example, legal and licensing requirements restrict some customers from delivering their applications outside certain countries. These customers can configure a whitelist that allows only viewers in those countries. Other customers need to prevent the downloading of their encrypted software by users in certain countries. These customers can configure a blacklist so that end-users from those countries are blocked from downloading their software.

Incorrect options:

**Use Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** - Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront helps in restricting traffic based on the user's geographic location. But, CloudFront works from edge locations and doesn't belong to a VPC. Hence, this option itself is incorrect and given only as a distractor.

An e-commerce company is looking for a solution with high availability, as it plans to migrate its flagship application to a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. The solution should allow for content-based routing as part of the architecture.

As a Solutions Architect, which of the following will you suggest for the company?

Use an Auto Scaling group for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure a Public IP address to mask any failure of an instance

Use a Network Load Balancer for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure a Private IP address to mask any failure of an instance

Use an Auto Scaling group for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure an elastic IP address (EIP) to mask any failure of an instance

Use an Application Load Balancer for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure Auto Scaling group to mask any failure of an instance

Las EIP no se pueden asociar a Load Balancer. El load balancer appliaction puede hacer content based routing el solo al poder leer los headers http. Puedes aumentar tu availability poniendo varias ec2 en distintas zonas de disponibilidad. Y redirigeiendo con el load balancer. (no puede entre varias regiones).

**Pregunta 52Incorrecto**

A media agency stores its re-creatable assets on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. The assets are accessed by a large number of users for the first few days and the frequency of access falls down drastically after a week. Although the assets would be accessed occasionally after the first week, but they must continue to be immediately accessible when required. The cost of maintaining all the assets on Amazon S3 storage is turning out to be very expensive and the agency is looking at reducing costs as much as possible.

As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, can you suggest a way to lower the storage costs while fulfilling the business requirements?

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 7 days

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 7 days

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 30 days

La cosa es que como pone “Its re-creatable” pues no buscas tanta seguridad y buscas el mas decuento.

The IT department at a consulting firm is conducting a training workshop for new developers. As part of an evaluation exercise on Amazon S3, the new developers were asked to identify the invalid storage class lifecycle transitions for objects stored on Amazon S3.

Can you spot the INVALID lifecycle transitions from the options below? (Select two)

Amazon S3 One Zone-IA => Amazon S3 Standard-IA

Amazon S3 Standard => Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering => Amazon S3 Standard

Amazon S3 Standard-IA => Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Amazon S3 Standard-IA => Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

The engineering team at an in-home fitness company is evaluating multiple in-memory data stores with the ability to power its on-demand, live leaderboard. The company's leaderboard requires high availability, low latency, and real-time processing to deliver customizable user data for the community of users working out together virtually from the comfort of their home.

As a solutions architect, which of the following solutions would you recommend? (Select two)

Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using Amazon RDS for Aurora as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using Amazon Neptune as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using Amazon DynamoDB as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using Amazon ElastiCache for Redis as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

Cuando se refiere a in-memory se refiere a memoria RAM por eso usaas elastic cache y Dynamo DB accelerator los dos almacenan en cache.

The engineering team at a data analytics company has observed that its flagship application functions at its peak performance when the underlying Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances have a CPU utilization of about 50%. The application is built on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances managed under an Auto Scaling group. The workflow requests are handled by an internal Application Load Balancer that routes the requests to the instances.

As a solutions architect, what would you recommend so that the application runs near its peak performance state?

Configure the Auto Scaling group to use simple scaling policy and set the CPU utilization as the target metric with a target value of 50%

Configure the Auto Scaling group to use step scaling policy and set the CPU utilization as the target metric with a target value of 50%

Configure the Auto Scaling group to use target tracking policy and set the CPU utilization as the target metric with a target value of 50%

Configure the Auto Scaling group to use a Amazon Cloudwatch alarm triggered on a CPU utilization threshold of 50%
