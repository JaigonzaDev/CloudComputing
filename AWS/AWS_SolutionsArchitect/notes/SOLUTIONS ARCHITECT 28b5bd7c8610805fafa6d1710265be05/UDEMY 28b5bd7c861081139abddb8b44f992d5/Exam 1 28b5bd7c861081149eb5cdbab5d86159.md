# Exam 1

A media company runs a photo-sharing web application that is accessed across three different countries. The application is deployed on several Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances running behind an Application Load Balancer. With new government regulations, the company has been asked to block access from two countries and allow access only from the home country of the company.

Which configuration should be used to meet this changed requirement?

Configure AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) on the Application Load Balancer in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

Configure the security group for the Amazon EC2 instances

Configure the security group on the Application Load Balancer

Use Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

AWS WAF se puede desplegar sobre Aplication Load Balancer, API Gateway, Cloudfront…

**Use Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** - Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront helps in restricting traffic based on the user's geographic location. But, CloudFront works from edge locations and doesn't belong to a VPC.

A leading video streaming service delivers billions of hours of content from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to customers around the world. Amazon S3 also serves as the data lake for its big data analytics solution. The data lake has a staging zone where intermediary query results are kept only for 24 hours. These results are also heavily referenced by other parts of the analytics pipeline.

Which of the following is the MOST cost-effective strategy for storing this intermediary query data?

Store the intermediary query results in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class

Store the intermediary query results in Amazon S3 Standard storage class

Store the intermediary query results in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class

Store the intermediary query results in Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class

S3 Standard Infrequent Access The minimum storage duration charge is 30 days, so this option is NOT cost-effective because intermediary query results need to be kept only for 24 hours. Hence this option is not correct.

Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics. As there is no minimum storage duration charge and no retrieval fee (remember that intermediary query results are heavily referenced by other parts of the analytics pipeline), this is the MOST cost-effective storage class amongst the given options.

A retail company's dynamic website is hosted using on-premises servers in its data center in the United States. The company is launching its website in Asia, and it wants to optimize the website loading times for new users in Asia. The website's backend must remain in the United States. The website is being launched in a few days, and an immediate solution is needed.

What would you recommend?

Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers

Migrate the website to Amazon S3. Use S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR) between AWS Regions in the US and Asia

Leverage a Amazon Route 53 geo-proximity routing policy pointing to on-premises servers

Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the DNS record of the website on Amazon Route 53

La gracía de este caso es que aprovechas las capacidades de caching de cloudfront quitar esa limitación de que los servidor estén solo en estados unidos. Realmente se esta acciediendo desde las zonas de cache no tanto desde los propios servidores on premise

Amazon CloudFront employs a global network of edge locations and regional edge caches that cache copies of your content close to your viewers. Amazon CloudFront ensures that end-user requests are served by the closest edge location. As a result, viewer requests travel a short distance, improving performance for your viewers. Therefore for the given use case, the users in Asia will enjoy a low latency experience while using the website even though the on-premises servers continue to be in the US.

**Leverage a Amazon Route 53 geo-proximity routing policy pointing to on-premises servers** - Since the on-premises servers continue to be in the US, so even using a Route 53 geo-proximity routing policy that directs the users in Asia to the on-premises servers in the US would not reduce the latency for the users in Asia. So this option is incorrect.

The product team at a startup has figured out a market need to support both stateful and stateless client-server communications via the application programming interface (APIs) developed using its platform. You have been hired by the startup as a solutions architect to build a solution to fulfill this market need using Amazon API Gateway.

Which of the following would you identify as correct?

Amazon API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that enable stateful client-server communication and Amazon API Gateway also creates WebSocket APIs that adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateless, full-duplex communication between client and server

Amazon API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that enable stateful client-server communication and Amazon API Gateway also creates WebSocket APIs that adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server

Amazon API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that enable stateless client-server communication and Amazon API Gateway also creates WebSocket APIs that adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server

Amazon API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that enable stateless client-server communication and Amazon API Gateway also creates WebSocket APIs that adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateless, full-duplex communication between client and server

**¿Por qué es stateful?**

- El servidor mantiene un **estado de sesión** en memoria o en almacenamiento temporal.
- Las solicitudes dependen del historial de interacción del cliente.
- Si el servidor se reinicia y la sesión no está en una base de datos persistente, el estado se pierde.

La **gran ventaja** de una **stateful API** es que **mantiene el estado** entre interacciones, evitando que el cliente tenga que **reenviar datos de autenticación o contexto en cada solicitud**.

En una **stateless API**, el servidor **NO mantiene el contexto** entre solicitudes. Cada vez que el cliente envía una petición, el servidor la trata como una nueva, sin recordar interacciones previas.

Te tienes que identificar en cada interacción.

A financial services company uses Amazon GuardDuty for analyzing its AWS account metadata to meet the compliance guidelines. However, the company has now decided to stop using Amazon GuardDuty service. All the existing findings have to be deleted and cannot persist anywhere on AWS Cloud.

Which of the following techniques will help the company meet this requirement?

Raise a service request with Amazon to completely delete the data from all their backups

Suspend the service in the general settings

De-register the service under services tab

Disable the service in the general settings

Disabling the service will delete all remaining data, including your findings and configurations before relinquishing the service permissions and resetting the service. So, this is the correct option for our use case.

A media agency stores its re-creatable assets on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. The assets are accessed by a large number of users for the first few days and the frequency of access falls down drastically after a week. Although the assets would be accessed occasionally after the first week, but they must continue to be immediately accessible when required. The cost of maintaining all the assets on Amazon S3 storage is turning out to be very expensive and the agency is looking at reducing costs as much as possible.

As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, can you suggest a way to lower the storage costs while fulfilling the business requirements?

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 7 days

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 7 days

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days

Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 30 days

The minimum storage duration is 30 days before you can transition objects from Amazon S3 Standard to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
