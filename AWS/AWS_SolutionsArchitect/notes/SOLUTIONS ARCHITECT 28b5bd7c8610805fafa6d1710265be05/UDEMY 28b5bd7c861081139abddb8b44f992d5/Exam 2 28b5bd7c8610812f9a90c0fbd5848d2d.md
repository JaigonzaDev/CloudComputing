# Exam 2

A financial services company wants a single log processing model for all the log files (consisting of system logs, application logs, database logs, etc) that can be processed in a serverless fashion and then durably stored for downstream analytics. The company wants to use an AWS managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of the log data and requires no ongoing administration.

As a solutions architect, which of the following AWS services would you recommend solving this problem?

Amazon EMR

AWS Lambda

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
