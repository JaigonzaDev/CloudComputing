# EXAM 12

A company has users all around the world accessing its HTTP-based application deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions. The company wants to improve the availability and performance of the application. The company also wants to protect the application against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. Static IP addresses are required.

What should a solutions architect recommend to accomplish this?

A. Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the NLBs as endpoints.

B. Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the ALBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the ALBs as endpoints.

C. Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the NLBs.

D. Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the ALBs. Deploy AWS WAF on the CloudFront distribution.

La a es la mejor opción ya que el NLB deja que llegue millones de solicitudes ya que es escalable.

A company has an application that collects data from loT sensors on automobiles. The data is streamed and stored in Amazon S3 through Amazon Kinesis Date Firehose The data produces trillions of S3 objects each year. Each morning, the company uses the data from the previous 30 days to retrain a suite of machine learning (ML) models. Four times each year, the company uses the data from the previous 12 months to perform analysis and train other ML models The data must be available with minimal delay for up to 1 year. After 1 year, the data must be retained for archival purposes.

Which storage solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Use the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year

B. Use the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically move objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year.

C. Use the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year.

D. Use the S3 Standard storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3

Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days, and then to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year.

- First 30 days- data access every morning ( predictable and frequently) – S3 standard - After 30 days, accessed 4 times a year – S3 infrequently access - Data preserved- S3 Gllacier Deep Archive

A company has an on-premises data center that is running out of storage capacity. The company wants to migrate its storage infrastructure to AWS while minimizing bandwidth costs. The solution must allow for immediate retrieval of data at no additional cost.

How can these requirements be met?

A. Deploy Amazon S3 Glacier Vault and enable expedited retrieval. Enable provisioned retrieval capacity for the workload.

B. Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using cached volumes. Use Storage Gateway to store data in Amazon S3 while retaining copies of frequently accessed data subsets locally.

C. Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using stored volumes to store data locally. Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3.

D. Deploy AWS Direct Connect to connect with the on-premises data center. Configure AWS Storage Gateway to store data locally. Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3.

The solution that will meet the requirements is to deploy AWS Storage Gateway using cached volumes and use Storage Gateway to store data in Amazon S3 while retaining copies of frequently accessed data subsets locally. This solution will allow the company to migrate its storage infrastructure to AWS while minimizing bandwidth costs, as it will only transfer data that is not cached locally. The solution will also allow for immediate retrieval of data at no additional cost, as the cached volumes will provide low-latency access to the most recently used data. The data stored in Amazon S3 will be durable, scalable, and secure. The other solutions are not as effective as the first one because they either do not meet the requirements or introduce additional costs or complexity. Deploying Amazon S3 Glacier Vault and enabling expedited retrieval will not meet the requirements, as it will incur additional costs for both storage and retrieval. Amazon S3 Glacier is a low-cost storage service for data archiving and backup, but it has longer retrieval times than Amazon S3. Expedited retrieval is a feature that allows faster access to data, but it charges a higher fee per GB retrieved. Provisioned retrieval capacity is a feature that reserves dedicated capacity for expedited retrievals, but it also charges a monthly fee per provisioned capacity unit. Deploying AWS Storage Gateway using stored volumes to store data locally and use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3 will not meet the requirements, as it will not migrate the storage infrastructure to AWS, but only create backups. Stored volumes are volumes that store the primary data locally and back up snapshots to Amazon S3. This solution will not reduce the storage capacity needed on-premises, nor will it leverage the benefits of cloud storage. Deploying AWS Direct Connect to connect with the on-premises data center and configuring AWS Storage Gateway to store data locally and use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3 will not meet the requirements, as it will also not migrate the storage infrastructure to AWS, but only create backups. AWS Direct Connect is a service that establishes a dedicated network connection between the on-premises data center and AWS, which can reduce network costs and increase bandwidth. However, this solution will also not reduce the storage capacity needed on-premises, nor will it leverage the benefits of cloud storage.

A company maintains an Amazon RDS database that maps users to cost centers. The company has accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations. The company needs a solution that will tag all resources that are created in a specific AWS account in the organization. The solution must tag each resource with the cost center ID of the user who created the resource.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Move the specific AWS account to a new organizational unit (OU) in Organizations from the management account. Create a service control policy (SCP) that requires all existing resources to have the correct cost center tag before the resources are created. Apply the SCP to the new OU.

B. Create an AWS Lambda function to tag the resources after the Lambda function looks up the appropriate cost center from the RDS database. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to AWS CloudTrail events to invoke the Lambda function.

C. Create an AWS CloudFormation stack to deploy an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to look up the appropriate cost center from the RDS database and to tag resources. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule to invoke the CloudFormation stack.

D. Create an AWS Lambda function to tag the resources with a default value. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to AWS CloudTrail events to invoke the Lambda function when a resource is missing the cost center tag.

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda can be used to tag resources with the cost center ID of the user who created the resource, by querying the RDS database that maps users to cost centers. Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that enables event-driven architectures. EventBridge can be configured to react to AWS CloudTrail events, which are recorded API calls made by or on behalf of the AWS account. EventBridge can invoke the Lambda function when a resource is created in the specific AWS account, passing the user identity and resource information as parameters. This solution will meet the requirements, as it enables automatic tagging of resources based on the user and cost center mapping.
