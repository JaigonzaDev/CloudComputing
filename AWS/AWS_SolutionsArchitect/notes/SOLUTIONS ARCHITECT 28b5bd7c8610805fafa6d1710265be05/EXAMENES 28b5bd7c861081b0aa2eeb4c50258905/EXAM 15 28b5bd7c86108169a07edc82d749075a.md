# EXAM 15

A company recently migrated its web application to AWS by rehosting the application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single AWS Region. The company wants to redesign its application architecture to be highly available and fault tolerant. Traffic must reach all running EC2 instances randomly.

Which combination of steps should the company take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Create an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy.

B. Create an Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy.

C. Create an Amazon Route 53 multivalue answer routing policy.

D. Launch three EC2 instances: two instances in one Availability Zone and one instance in another Availability Zone.

E. Launch four EC2 instances: two instances in one Availability Zone and two instances in another Availability Zone.

### **Simple Routing**

Use a [simple routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-simple.html) policy for traffic that requires standard DNS records only and doesn't require special options such as weighted or latency routing. You can't use multiple records of the same name and type with simple routing. However, a single record can contain multiple values (such as IP addresses).

Use a simple routing policy to achieve any of the following.

- Create only one [basic record](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-basic.html) of each name and type.
- Route traffic to a single resource (such as your website's web server).
- Route traffic to a single record with multiple values (such as an A record that specifies multiple IP addresses).**Note:** Route 53 returns the values in a random order to the client, and you can't weight or determine the order with a simple routing policy.

### **Multivalue Answer Routing**

Use a [multivalue answer routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-multivalue.html) policy to achieve any of the following.

- Create more than one record of the same name and type.
- Distribute DNS responses across multiple resources.
- Return multiple values for a DNS query and route traffic to multiple IP addresses.
- Route traffic to multiple resources.
- Associate a Route 53 health check with your routing records.

A company's website uses an Amazon EC2 instance store for its catalog of items. The company wants to make sure that the catalog is highly available and that the catalog is stored in a durable location.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Move the catalog to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.

B. Deploy a larger EC2 instance with a larger instance store.

C. Move the catalog from the instance store to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

D. Move the catalog to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.

Moving the catalog to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system provides both high availability and durability. Amazon EFS is a fully-managed, highly-available, and durable file system that is built to scale on demand. With Amazon EFS, the catalog data can be stored and accessed from multiple EC2 instances in different availability zones, ensuring high availability. Also, Amazon EFS automatically stores files redundantly within and across multiple availability zones, making it a durable storage option.

At part of budget planning. management wants a report of AWS billed dams listed by user. The data will be used to create department budgets. A solution architect needs to determine the most efficient way to obtain this report Information

Which solution meets these requirement?

A. Run a query with Amazon Athena to generate the report.

B. Create a report in Cost Explorer and download the report

C. Access the bill details from the running dashboard and download Via bill.

D. Modify a cost budget in AWS Budgets to alert with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES).

This option is the most efficient because it uses Cost Explorer, which is a tool that allows you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time1. You can create a report in Cost Explorer that lists AWS billed items by user, using the user name tag as a filter2. You can then download the report as a CSV file and use it for budget planning. Option A is less efficient because it uses Amazon Athena, which is a serverless interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL3. You would need to set up an Athena table that points to your AWS Cost and Usage Report data in S3, and then run a query to generate the report. This would incur additional costs and complexity. Option C is less efficient because it uses the billing dashboard, which provides a high-level summary of your AWS costs and usage.

You can access the bill details from the billing dashboard and download them via bill, but this would not list the billed items by user. You would need to use tags to group your costs by user name, which would require additional steps. Option D is less efficient because it uses AWS Budgets, which is a tool that allows you to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations. You can modify a cost budget in AWS Budgets to alert with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), but this would not generate a report of AWS billed items by user. This would only notify you when your actual or forecasted costs exceed or are expected to exceed your budgeted amount.

- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Ideal para crear **informes detallados** y visuales de los costes por usuario si has utilizado **etiquetas** para identificar a los usuarios.
- **AWS Budgets**: Ideal para **hacer seguimiento** de los costes de cada usuario y configurar alertas cuando se superen ciertos límites.
- **AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)**: Ideal para análisis detallados de costes a nivel de uso, exportándolos a S3 y procesándolos con Athena.
