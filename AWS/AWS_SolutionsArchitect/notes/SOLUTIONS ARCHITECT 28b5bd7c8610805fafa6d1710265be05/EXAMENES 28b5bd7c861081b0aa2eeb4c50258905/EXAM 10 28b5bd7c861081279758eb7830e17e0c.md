# EXAM 10

A solutions architect is designing a multi-tier application for a company. The application's users upload images from a mobile device. The application generates a thumbnail of each image and returns a message to the user to confirm that the image was uploaded successfully.

The thumbnail generation can take up to 60 seconds, but the company wants to provide a faster response time to its users to notify them that the original image was received. The solutions architect must design the application to asynchronously dispatch requests to the different application tiers.

What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Write a custom AWS Lambda function to generate the thumbnail and alert the user. Use the image upload process as an event source to invoke the Lambda function.

B. Create an AWS Step Functions workflow Configure Step Functions to handle the orchestration between the application tiers and alert the user when thumbnail generation is complete

C. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) message queue. As images are uploaded, place a message on the SQS queue for thumbnail generation. Alert the user through an application message that the image was received

D. Create Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification topics and subscriptions Use one subscription with the application to generate the thumbnail after the image upload is complete. Use a second subscription to message the user's mobile app by way of a push notification after thumbnail generation is complete.

La clave esta en “the application to asynchronously” cuando es asincrono se necesita SQS para que se vaya procesando cuando se pueda. La opción B no mejora nada añade complejidad.

A company is running a legacy system on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application code cannot be modified, and the system cannot run on more than one instance. A solutions architect must design a resilient solution that can improve the recovery time for the system.

What should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

A. Enable termination protection for the EC2 instance.

B. Configure the EC2 instance for Multi-AZ deployment.

C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to recover the EC2 instance in case of failure.

D. Launch the EC2 instance with two Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that use RAID configurations for storage redundancy.

La opción C es la correcta ya que pone que no pueden correr mas que una sola instancia por lo que un Multi-AZ no es posible tendrías que poner un cloudwatch con una alarma para que si se cae recuperarlo.

A company needs to keep user transaction data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. The company must retain the data for 7 years.

What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

A. Use DynamoDB point-in-time recovery to back up the table continuously.

B. Use AWS Backup to create backup schedules and retention policies for the table.

C. Create an on-demand backup of the table by using the DynamoDB console. Store the backup in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set an S3 Lifecycle configuration for the S3 bucket.

D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to back up the table and to store the backup in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set an S3 Lifecycle configuration for the S3 bucket.

A company uses Amazon API Gateway to run a private gateway with two REST APIs in the same VPC. The BuyStock RESTful web service calls the CheckFunds RESTful web service to ensure that enough funds are available before a stock can be purchased. The company has noticed in the VPC flow logs that the BuyStock RESTful web service calls the CheckFunds RESTful web service over the internet instead of through the VPC. A solutions architect must implement a solution so that the APIs communicate through the VPC.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the FEWEST changes to the code?

A. Add an X-APl-Key header in the HTTP header for authorization.

B. Use an interface endpoint.

C. Use a gateway endpoint.

D. Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue between the two REST APIs.

✅ **Usar un Interface Endpoint** cuando:

- Necesitas conectar **API Gateway, Lambda, SQS, SNS, etc.** de forma privada dentro de la VPC.
- Requieres un **DNS privado** para acceder al servicio dentro de la VPC.
- Necesitas un **control de acceso más granular** con **Security Groups**.

✅ **Usar un Gateway Endpoint** cuando:

- Necesitas acceder a **S3 o DynamoDB sin usar Internet**.
- Quieres **ahorrar costos** (porque los Gateway Endpoints son gratuitos).
- Prefieres administrar el tráfico con **tablas de enrutamiento en la VPC**.
