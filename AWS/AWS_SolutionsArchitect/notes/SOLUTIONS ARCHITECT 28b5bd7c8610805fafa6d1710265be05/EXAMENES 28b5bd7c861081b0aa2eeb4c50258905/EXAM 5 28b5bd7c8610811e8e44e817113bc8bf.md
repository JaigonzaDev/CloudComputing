# EXAM 5

A company has users all around the world accessing its HTTP-based application deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions. The company wants to improve the availability and performance of the application. The company also wants to protect the application against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. Static IP addresses are required.

What should a solutions architect recommend to accomplish this?

A. Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the NLBs as endpoints.

B. Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the ALBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the ALBs as endpoints.

C. Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the NLBs.

D. Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the ALBs. Deploy AWS WAF on the CloudFront distribution.

Según el chat gpt la tengo yo bien ya que el WAF es mejor desplegarlo en ALBs.

A developer has an application that uses an AWS Lambda function to upload files to Amazon S3 and needs the required permissions to perform the task The developer already has an IAM user with valid IAM credentials required for Amazon S3

What should a solutions architect do to grant the permissions?

A. Add required IAM permissions in the resource policy of the Lambda function

B. Create a signed request using the existing IAM credentials n the Lambda function

C. Create a new IAM user and use the existing IAM credentials in the Lambda function.

D. Create an IAM execution role with the required permissions and attach the IAM rote to the Lambda function

Claro esq la pregunta es un poco confusa y yo creia que tenia ya el rol creado para el lambda pero realmente a lo que se refiere es que el rol creado que tiene es el del propio usuario developer y deberías asignar un rol lambda para seguir el principio de least privilege

A company is planning to move its data to an Amazon S3 bucket. The data must be encrypted when it is stored in the S3 bucket. Additionally, the encryption key must be automatically rotated every year.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Move the data to the S3 bucket. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use the built-in key rotation behavior of SSE-S3 encryption keys.

B. Create an AWS Key Management Service {AWS KMS) customer managed key. Enable automatic key rotation. Set the S3 bucket's default encryption behavior to use the customer managed KMS key. Move the data to the S3 bucket.

C. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Set the S3 bucket's default encryption behavior to use the customer managed KMS key. Move the data to the S3 bucket. Manually rotate the KMS key every year.

D. Encrypt the data with customer key material before moving the data to the S3 bucket. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key without key material. Import the customer key material into the KMS key. Enable automatic key rotation.

Por eso, si una empresa necesita **control sobre la rotación de claves** o auditar el uso de estas claves, **SSE-S3 no es la mejor opción**. En su lugar, se recomienda usar **AWS KMS con Customer Managed Keys (CMK)**, que **sí permite rotación automática visible y auditable**.

A research company runs experiments that are powered by a simulation application and a visualization application. The simulation application runs on Linux and outputs intermediate data to an NFS share every 5 minutes. The visualization application is a Windows desktop application that displays the simulation output and requires an SMB file system.

The company maintains two synchronized file systems. This strategy is causing data duplication and inefficient resource usage. The company needs to migrate the applications to AWS without making code changes to either application. 

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Migrate both applications to AWS Lambda. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to exchange data between the applications.

B. Migrate both applications to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon FSx File Gateway for storage

C. Migrate the simulation application to Linux Amazon EC2 instances. Migrate the visualization application to Windows EC2 instances. Configure Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to exchange data between the applications.

D. Migrate the simulation application to Linux Amazon EC2 instances. Migrate the visualization application to Windows EC2 instances. Configure Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for storage.

Aquí la clave de la pregunta es que pone que tiene que utilizar dos sistemas un EFS y EBS y que tienen problemas de sincronización por ello, la respuesta correcta es la D ya que Amazon FSx for NetApp Ontap for storage te permite usar las dos opciones a la vez. Fsx file Gateway no permite hacer esto.
