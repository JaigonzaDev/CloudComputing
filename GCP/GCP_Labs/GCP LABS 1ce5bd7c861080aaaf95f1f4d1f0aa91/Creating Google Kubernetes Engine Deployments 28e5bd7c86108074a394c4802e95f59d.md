# Creating Google Kubernetes Engine Deployments

# **Overview**

In this lab, you explore the basics of using deployment manifests. Manifests are files that contain configurations required for a deployment that can be used across different Pods. Manifests are easy to change.

# **Objectives**

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Create deployment manifests, deploy to cluster, and verify Pod rescheduling as nodes are disabled.
- Trigger manual scaling up and down of Pods in deployments.
- Trigger deployment rollout (rolling update to new version) and rollbacks.
- Perform a Canary deployment.
