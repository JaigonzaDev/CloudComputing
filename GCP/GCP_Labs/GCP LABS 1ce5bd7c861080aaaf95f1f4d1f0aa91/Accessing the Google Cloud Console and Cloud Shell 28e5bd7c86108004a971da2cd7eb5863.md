# Accessing the Google Cloud Console and Cloud Shell

# **Overview**

In this lab, you become familiar with Google Cloud's web-based interface. Two integrated environments are available:

- A GUI environment called the Google Cloud console
- A command-line interface called Cloud Shell, which has the commands from the Cloud SDK pre-installed

In this course, you use both environments.

You need to know a few things about the Google Cloud console:

- The Google Cloud console is under continuous development, so the graphical layout occasionally changes. These changes are often made to accommodate new Google Cloud features or changes in the technology, resulting in a slightly different workflow.
- You can perform most common Google Cloud actions in the Google Cloud console. Sometimes new features are implemented in the Cloud SDK before they are made available in the Google Cloud console.
- The Google Cloud console is extremely fast for some activities. The Google Cloud console can perform multiple actions on your behalf that might require many command-line actions.
- The commands in the Cloud SDK are valuable tools for automation.
