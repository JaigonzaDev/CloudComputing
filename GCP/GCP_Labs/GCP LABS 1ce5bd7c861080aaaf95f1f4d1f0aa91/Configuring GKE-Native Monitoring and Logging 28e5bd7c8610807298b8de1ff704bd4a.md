# Configuring GKE-Native Monitoring and Logging

# **Overview**

In this lab, you build a GKE cluster and then deploy pods for use with Kubernetes Engine Monitoring. You will create charts and a custom dashboard, work with custom metrics, and create and respond to alerts.

**Note:** For this lab, GKE Standard Mode will be used. The lab explores System logging and monitoring and these are enabled by default in GKE Autopilot.

# Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Use Kubernetes Engine Monitoring to view cluster and workload metrics
- Use Cloud Monitoring Alerting to receive notifications about the cluster’s health
