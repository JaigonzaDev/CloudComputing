# Compute Logging and Monitoring

# **Overview**

Google Cloud has a number of compute-related resources including Compute Engine, Kubernetes, and Cloud Run. In this exercise, you install the logging and monitoring agents into a VM running a Nginx server to maximize the metrics to easily view. You also set up a Kubernetes cluster and monitor an application deployed into it.

# Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Set up a VM and a GKE cluster.
- Install and use the logging and monitoring agents for Compute Engine.
- Add a service to the GKE cluster and examine its logs and metrics.
