# Configure an Internal Network Load Balancer

# **Overview**

Google Cloud offers internal Network Load Balancing for your TCP/UDP-based traffic. Internal Network Load Balancing enables you to run and scale your services behind a private load balancing IP address that is accessible only to your internal virtual machine instances.

In this lab, you create two managed instance groups in the same region. Then you configure and test an internal Network Load Balancer with the instances groups as the backends, as shown in this network diagram:
