# Getting Started with VPC Networking and Google Compute Engine

# **Overview**

Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides networking functionality to Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, Kubernetes Engine containers, and App Engine flexible environment. In other words, without a VPC network you cannot create VM instances, containers, or App Engine applications. Therefore, each Google Cloud project has a **default** network to get you started.

You can think of a VPC network as similar to a physical network, except that it is virtualized within Google Cloud. A VPC network is a global resource that consists of a list of regional virtual subnetworks (subnets) in data centers, all connected by a global wide area network (WAN). VPC networks are logically isolated from each other in Google Cloud.

In this lab, you create an auto mode VPC network with firewall rules and two VM instances. Then, you explore the connectivity for the VM instances.

# Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Explore the default VPC network
- Create an auto mode network with firewall rules
- Create VM instances using Compute Engine
- Explore the connectivity for VM instances
