# Monitoring and Dashboarding Multiple Projects

# **Overview**

Cloud Monitoring empowers users with the ability to monitor multiple projects from a single metrics scope. In this exercise, you start with three Google Cloud projects, two with monitorable resources, and the third you use to host a metrics scope. You attach the two resource projects to the metrics scope, build uptime checks, and construct a centralized dashboard.

# Objectives

- Configure a Worker project.
- Create a metrics scope and link the two worker projects into it.
- Create and configure Monitoring Groups.
- Create and test an uptime check.
