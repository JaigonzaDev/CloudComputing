# Configure an Application Load Balancer (HTTP) with Autoscaling

# **Overview**

Application Load Balancing (HTTP/HTTPS) is implemented at the edge of Google's network in Google's points of presence (POP) around the world. User traffic directed to an Application Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS) enters the POP closest to the user and is then load-balanced over Google's global network to the closest backend that has sufficient available capacity.

In this lab, you configure an Application Load Balancer (HTTP) as shown in the diagram below. Then, you stress test the load balancer to demonstrate global load balancing and autoscaling.
